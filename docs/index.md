# Oxford/Cambridge Alumni Group Database - User Guide

This database is accessed by alumni when registering for events, joining, renewing, or modifying any of their personal information or mailing list selections. Alumni will be using links on the web site or in email notices to register for events, join mailing lists or as members, and simply have to follow the instructions on the pages they visit.

This guide is intended for the volunteer organizers helping to run the organization whose interactions with the database are more complicated. To return to this page from elsewhere in the guide click on the title.

The database includes:

- all member information (including current and past members, and mailing list subscribers)
- event information
- records of all membership dues payments
- records of event registrations
- accounting information
- the online payment mechanism
- email and notice capability

Organizers are assigned different access rights depending on their need to modify the database. All have the ability to search/view member information, event registrations, etc.

The landing page of the database application is reached, for example, at [https://oxcamne.pythonanywhere.com/oxcam](https://oxcamne.pythonanywhere.com/oxcam) for the OxCamNE database hosted on PythonAnywhere. However to reach the index page as shown below, a user must login using their email address. Oxcam responds by sending an email with a link containing a one-time security code to verify the email address. Clicking that link opens the index page as shown below. Anyone with an email address can do this.

The page banner for the Society is followed by a menu bar. Both the menu bar and the content depend on the user identified by the email address.

The **Home** button links to the home page of the Society's public web site, and is always shown. Hovering over **MyAccount** produces a dropdown menu:

- *MyAccount* returns from anywhere to this page
- *Directory* takes you to the member directory
- *Logout* does what it says!

The [**members**](members), [**events**,](events.md) [**accounts**](accounts.md), and **help** buttons are shown only to organizers of the group who have been granted database access rights, and lead to the corresponding modules of the application.

If you are installing or supporting the database you will find [**additional help here**](support.md).
