# [Oxford/Cambridge Alumni Group Database - Support Guide](index.md)

This section of the guide covers installation and support and is intended for the more tech-savvy volunteer organizer charged with installing and maintaining the organization's IT infrastructure. To return to this page from elsewhere in the guide click on the title.

The online database is an open source [project](https://github.com/oxcamne/oxcam). Please start by reading the project README you will see there (you probably came here from there!).

 Oxcam is a [Python](https://www.python.org) App running under the open source web framework [Py4web](https://github.com/web2py/py4web). Please see the Py4web documentation for information on it's installation.

You need a web server belonging to the organization. OxCamNE uses PythonAnywhere and has an account there with username 'oxcamne', hence the database is reached at [https://oxcamne.pythonanywhere.com/oxcam](https://oxcamne.pythonanywhere.com/oxcam). This is a low cost and relatively straightforward option. Whatever your choice of web server, first ensure that the prerequisites described in the README are satisfied and that you have Py4web up and running on your web server. The Py4web documentation has information on installing Py4web on a variety of environments. Finally [**install the oxcam app**](install).
