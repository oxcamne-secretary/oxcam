## Event Registration

This page displays the full information about a member's event registration including guests. It can be reached either through the [reservation list](reservation_list.md) or through the [member reservations](member_reservations.md) page:

The **back** link will take you back to the events page.

Links allow you to send email to the member, or to pop out to view the member's record.

This page can be used to build a reservation on a member's behalf (e.g. for a speaker), as well as to view/edit reservations made by the members themselves.

Note that you can drill down to edit the individual guest, and delete guests. If there are no additional guests, you can delete the member's own registration.

If a member pays for an event by check, you would use the expanded reservation to record the check payment (in the members own row)

To allocate space to a wait listed member edit the members row to clear the wait list tick box. The member can then make any necessary payment online by revisiting the booking link.
